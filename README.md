# Single Sign-On

This is an extension only compatible with Pterodactyl 2.0.

Lets users sign in to the panel with an external account. Built as a module that can be expanded to add support for other third-parties.

**Included Providers:**
- Discord
- GitHub
- Google
- GitLab
- Microsoft
- Steam

## Install

Download [sso.pteroext](https://github.com/pterodactyl/SSO-Extension/releases/latest/download/sso.pteroext)
from the latest release, then on the panel host, either run:

```sh
php artisan p:extension:install /path/to/sso.zip --enable
```

Or install the extension using the admin panel under Admin > Extensions.

You must then reload the panel, then you can find the configuration under Admin > Extensions > Single Sign-On.

## Adding a provider

Each provider lives in its own directory under `providers/`. The extension discovers them; there is no list to edit.

```
providers/GitHub/
  GitHubProvider.php   # class Sso\Providers\GitHub\GitHubProvider
  brand.tsx            # optional: button colours and logo
```

Most providers use OAuth 2. For those, extend `Sso\OAuth2Provider` and fill in the endpoints, scopes and mapping:

```php
namespace Sso\Providers\GitHub;

final class GitHubProvider extends OAuth2Provider
{
    public function id(): string { return 'github'; }
    public function name(): string { return 'GitHub'; }
    protected function authorizeEndpoint(): string { return 'https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize'; }
    protected function tokenEndpoint(): string { return 'https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token'; }
    protected function userEndpoint(): string { return 'https://api.github.com/user'; }
    protected function scopes(): array { return ['read:user', 'user:email']; }
    protected function mapIdentity(array $user): ExternalIdentity { /* ... */ }
}
```

The directory name, the namespace segment and the class prefix must match (`providers/GitHub` → `Sso\Providers\GitHub\GitHubProvider`). The enable, client ID and client secret settings, the routes, the login button and the Connections row all come from that class.

If the user endpoint does not return everything `mapIdentity()` needs, override `enrich()`. It runs after the profile is fetched and before `mapIdentity()`. It receives the access token and the profile array, and returns the array that gets passed to `mapIdentity()`. By default it returns the profile unchanged.

GitHub uses it to fetch a verified email, because the email on the profile is optional and not verified:

```php
protected function enrich(string $token, array $user): array
{
    try {
        $emails = Http::acceptJson()->timeout(10)->withToken($token)->get('https://api.github.com/user/emails')->throw()->json();
    } catch (Throwable) {
        return $user;
    }

    foreach (is_array($emails) ? $emails : [] as $entry) {
        if (is_array($entry) && ($entry['primary'] ?? false) === true && ($entry['verified'] ?? false) === true && is_string($entry['email'] ?? null)) {
            return [...$user, 'sso_email' => $entry['email']];
        }
    }

    return $user;
}
```

Any exception thrown in `enrich()` fails the sign-in. If the extra data is optional, catch the exception and return `$user` as it is, like GitHub does.

OAuth 2 providers use PKCE (S256) by default: the authorization request carries a `code_challenge`, and the token request carries the matching `code_verifier`. If a provider rejects these parameters, override `usesPkce()` to return `false`.

A provider that does not extend `Sso\OAuth2Provider` implements `Sso\Contracts\IdentityProvider` directly. If it uses OAuth 2 and supports PKCE, implement `Sso\Contracts\SupportsPkce` instead, and the extension will generate the verifier and pass it in.

If the callback does not carry an OAuth 2 `code` query parameter, implement `Sso\Contracts\ReadsCallback` as well. Its `callbackCode()` receives the callback request after the state has been checked, and returns the string that is passed to `identify()` as `$code`, or `null` when the user cancelled. Steam uses it to pass on its OpenID 2.0 assertion, see `providers/Steam/SteamProvider.php`.

## Steam

Steam only offers OpenID 2.0, so it needs no client ID or secret: enabling it is enough. The optional Web API key (from https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey) is used to fetch the Steam display name and avatar; without one, the Steam ID is shown instead.

Steam does not share an email address, so "Link accounts by verified email" never applies to it. Users have to connect Steam from Account > Connections before they can sign in with it.

Without a `brand.tsx`, the provider gets a neutral button. With one, it exports its colours and logo, keyed by the provider's `id` (see `providers/Discord/brand.tsx`). Rebuild the frontend (`npm run build`) after adding or changing a brand.
